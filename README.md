## Mobile Food Ordering App 

### Scenario

You have just been recruited at Ohmyfood as a junior developer. Congratulations!


Ohmyfood is an emerging startup aiming to make a significant impact in the restaurant industry. The goal is to create a fully mobile-friendly website that showcases the menus of gourmet restaurants. Beyond a traditional reservation system, customers will have the ability to pre-select the dishes they want to enjoy, ensuring their meals are ready upon arrival. Say goodbye to long waits at restaurants!

You are one of the four lucky ones who have the chance to work on this project.

The team is composed of :

-Paul, the CTO of the future site. -Emily, the UX designer, recruited to create the site’s UI design. -Anissa, the sales representative in charge of canvassing the restaurants. -You, in charge of the development of the site.

Anissa is in the process of contacting the restaurants for this project. When she runs into you at the coffee machine, she says:

Have you heard the news? Remember the sales manager of your favorite restaurant? I managed to convince him and three others to put their menus online! I'll send you the file with the four menus in the afternoon. It's up to you now!

With the team, you decide that the prototype will contain these fourmenus.

Here is the brief you draw up with the CTO, Paul. Back at your desk, you find the mock-ups of the site in your mailbox, sent by Emily.
